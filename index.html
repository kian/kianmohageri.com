          Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in
          the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are
          cold and are not clothed.  This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is
          spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of
          its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school
          in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of
          60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty
          miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million
          bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have
          housed more than 8,000 people.... This is not a way of life at all, in any
          true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a
          cross of iron.

        <p>
          The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of
          the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring
          into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which
          might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the
          long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed,
          their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without
          producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has
          locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships.
          Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit
          to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is
          built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus
          that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the
          needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is
          a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an
          advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere
          near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the
          importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one
          group and another.
